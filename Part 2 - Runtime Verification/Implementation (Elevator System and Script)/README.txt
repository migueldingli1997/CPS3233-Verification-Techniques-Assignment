The elevator system can be run without monitors by executing
any of the two compile_and_run_without_monitors scripts.

No script is provided to run the system with the monitoring code;
This must be done by importing the code into an IDE. For this
task, the IntelliJ IDE was used with the compiler set to ajc.

The source folder also includes copies of the compiled Larva files.
